# PokeMemory

PokeMemory is a very simple memory game utilizing the PokeAPI. 
The rule of the game is very simple: once you click a pocket monster 
the cards will shuffle. Try clicking them all without repeating. Your 
score will reset if you do.
This project was built with React and was a good way to practice with
styled-components.
